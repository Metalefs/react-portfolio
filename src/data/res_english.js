    description: `üëã My name is Jackson Pires. I'm working with the newest front-end frameworks like Angular, React and Vue. 
      I work with technologies:
        Nodejs,
        .Net Core,
        Angular &
        React.
      
      My main interest at the moment has been to decouple monolithic applications by orchestrating them following a microservice architecture pattern.
      
      I have extra knowledge of technologies:
        Asp.Net MVC and Web Forms &
        PHP.
      
      I work with native Application development in technologies:
        Xamarin.Forms,
      
      I am interested in developing native applications with React Native, or other Cross-Platform frameworks in the future. `,
